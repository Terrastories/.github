## About Terrastories
*Terrastories* is a geostorytelling application built to enable indigenous and other local communities to locate and map their own oral storytelling traditions about places of significant meaning or value to them. Community members can add places and stories through a user-friendly interface, and make decisions about designating certain stories as private or restricted. It is a dockerized Rails app that uses Mapbox to help users locate content geographically on an interactive map. Terrastories is designed to be entirely offline-compatible, so that remote communities can access the application entirely without needing internet connectivity.

## Get involved!
We always welcome [contributions](https://github.com/Terrastories/terrastories#contributing) and are currently looking for more stewards to take a more active role in determining the future direction of Terrastories, helping review open-source PRs, and generally being active on our small developer team. This is currently on a volunteer basis but we've gotten small amounts of funding before to sponsor stewardship work. Please contact us if you are interested!
